## Project: US Coal Production

Visualization and mapping of trends in coal mining in the United States. Raw data were obtained in `txt` files from the **Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)**, which is under the US Department of Labor. This project demonstrates trends in coal over several decades, identifying patterns in production and employment. These data are intended to be integrated into a larger EPA dataset linking environmental and economic variables together.

This project utilizes the `ggplot`, `maps`, and the `chloroplethr` R packages.
