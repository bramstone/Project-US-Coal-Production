## Project: US Coal Production

Visualization and mapping of trends in coal mining in the United States. Raw data were obtained from the **Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)** -- which is under the US Department of Labor -- in `txt` files. This project demonstrates trends in coal over several decades, identifying patterns in production and employment, and includes final datasets for further exploration. These data are intended to be integrated into a larger EPA dataset linking environmental and economic variables together.

This project utilizes the `ggplot`, `data.table`, `maps`, and `chloroplethr` packages.
